[**Click here for LIVE DEMO**](https://aviation-manager.herokuapp.com/)
This app has been bootstrapped using create react app and for UI framework I have used Material UI library.
Spent time: Aprrox. 6hours

Current working functionalities: 

 - Fetching all data from provided API
 - Creating rotation list from avaiable flights
 - Calculating percentage usage for that day for the aircraft
 - Creating new aircraft



Todo, i.e. didn't manage on time:

 - delete rotation
 - stop event for adding new flight into rotation list when usage has been breached
 - accessing new aircraft to create seperate rotations for it
 - edit rotation details
 - Certain UI bugs on different screens
